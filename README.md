# picojpeg
Adapted from https://code.google.com/archive/p/picojpeg
This version of picojpeg is derived from https://code.google.com/archive/p/picojpeg,
originally written by Rich Geldreich <richgel99@gmail.com>
It has been changed to be reentrant, to support scanline decoding, to include RGB565 output,
and to support decoding a window within (or enclosing) the image.
